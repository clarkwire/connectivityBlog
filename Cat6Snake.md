Ethernet is the most commonly used computer networking technology for local area networks (LANs) and is ETL verified to <em>TIA-568-C.2</em> and <em>ISO/IEC 11801</em>.
<br/>
As technology advances Ethernet continues to find its way into other applications. In fact, it is becoming the cable of choice for high-level industrial applications and harsh environment landscapes.

<div style="font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif; font-size: 18px; margin-top: -25px;">
In order for Ethernet to be used in the industrial environment,
the cables and connectors must be adapted to withstand
environmental conditions that are not present in commercial
installations. These conditions include:
<ul>
<li>Oil</li>
<li>Chemical
</li>
<li>Sunlight
</li>
<li>Abrasion prone
</li>
<li>Flexing
</li>
</ul>
In addition to harsh environmental conditions, environmental noise can have a negative affect on
network performance. Electrical noise from nearby AC or DC circuits, electrical motors, and other electrical equipment 
may result in increased RFI and EMI interference, which can decrease system performance. 
<br />
Industrial network connectivity needs be able to withstand all of these conditions and still reliably perform. 
More and more industrial applications require clean data, which increasingly makes Ethernet the optimal solution for todayâ€™s
industrial environments.
