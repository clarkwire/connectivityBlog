The Sports Video Group is pleased to welcome Clark Wire & Cable as a corporate sponsor. Since 1989, Clark Wire & Cable has been a leader in broadcast and professional A/V-interconnect technology. With a focus on quality and innovation, the company delivers unique and reliable solutions dedicated to the markets it serves.

From precision-engineered bulk cable and cable assemblies to connectors, tools, and custom panels, Clark Wire has remained committed to delivering comprehensive interconnect solutions.

Focusing on sports venues and mobile production technologies, Clark continues to expand and develop products for these markets. New broadcast- and mobile-production offerings include Clark SMPTE hybrid fiber cables in portable, permanent installation, and three-channel constructions; triax and SMPTE-fiber cable testers; distribution panels and patchbays; and HD-SDI coaxial cables and connectors.

“Joining the Sports Video Group is a natural fit for Clark Wire & Cable,” says President Shane Collins. “For almost 30 years, Clark Wire & Cable has been dedicated to servicing the sports-broadcast and -production markets, and our newer products are delivering even more solutions for mobile broadcasters and large venue installations. We look forward to personally participating in the SVG events in the coming years, meeting old friends, and making new ones.”

The company’s growing list of sports-venue clients includes the Minnesota Vikings, Los Angeles Chargers, Milwaukee Bucks, Sacramento Kings, and Detroit Red Wings. Clark has worked with MLS teams Orlando City and LA FC on their venue projects, as well as with such universities as Duke (basketball and football), Grand Canyon, Ole Miss, and Mississippi State. Clark Wire & Cable also has had a hand in MLB’s Instant Replay System and ESPN’s Pier 17 Studios.

The company recently introduced its CWT-SMPTE tester for SMPTE format hybrid camera cables. Designed to quickly identify working or faulty cables in the field with a single test, the CWT-SMPTE simultaneously tests for loss in the fiber elements and all combinations of opens, shorts, or cross-wiring within the electrical elements. The results are displayed on the OLED screen on the transmitter unit as loss in decibels and a graphical pinout of the electrical contacts, making it simple to identify the faulty element.</div>
