The ability to transmit enormous amounts of data over long distances in a flash is a distinct advantage 
of fiber optic cables. Fiber installers; however, must ensure that contamination on the fiber connectors is minimized in order to stay within the acceptable range of data loss.  Oil and dust particles small enough to be invisible to the naked eye are large enough to block the entire 9-micrometer core diameter of a single mode fiber. Smaller soils increase signal attenuation and return loss and have the potential to cause permanent damage to the connectors.

Most contaminants are impossible to see without the aid of a microscope; keep in mind that 
the fiber core is several times smaller than a human hair.  Furthermore, the act of mating 
and de-mating connectors causes dust particles outside of critical areas to accumulate and 
redistribute onto the connector end face (TIA-455-240, page 19).  

Additionally, mating a dirty plug cross contaminates the other plug.  
It is critical to inspect and when necessary clean every connection every time it is mated, including unmated plugs which were previously found to be clean.

The service and quality of product is what drew Carlson to Clark product and ultimately helped him decide to use them for this project.
