BMO Harris Bradley Center has housed the Milwaukee Bucks, Marquette University Golden Eagle's and decades of concerts for 30 years. Now, they are ready to let go of this building full of memories, so a new building can move in downtown, Fiserv Forum.

Construction began back in June 2016, where Mortenson Construction, ICON Venue Group, and Parsons Electric came together to build the $524 million project. The venue will be able to hold the capacity of 17,500 and it measures out to 714,000 square feet. Along with the arena, the building will take up 4th St. and Juneau Ave. with an entertainment plaza. The center is designed to share the history as well as the personality of Milwaukee. The first event the building hosted was on September 4, 2018 with "The Killers" and "The Violent Femmes" along with four other events to follow this month. Throughout the building, cabling from Clark was used.

Specifically, Clark provided the interlocking armored optical fiber cables, the hybrid SMPTE camera cables, triax camera cables, multi and single pair audio cables, HD/SDI coaxial cables, network cables, photostobe cables, speaker cables, and custom panels for this project.

Carlson also shared that Clark Wire and Cable handled other crutial aspects of the project brilliantly.

The service and quality of product is what drew Carlson to Clark product and ultimately helped him decide to use them for this project.

In October, the Milwaukee Bucks officially move in to take on the first games of their pre-season.
