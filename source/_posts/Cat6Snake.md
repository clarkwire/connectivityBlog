Ethernet is the most commonly used computer networking
technology for local area networks (LANs) and is
ETL verified to <em>TIA-568-C.2</em> and <em>ISO/IEC 11801</em>. As technology advances Ethernet continues to find
its way into other applications. In fact, it is becoming the
cable of choice for high-level industrial applications and harsh environment landscapes.

In order for Ethernet to be used in the industrial environment,
the cables and connectors must be adapted to withstand
environmental conditions that are not present in commercial
installations. These conditions include:
<ul>
<li>Oil</li>
<li>Chemical
</li>
<li>Sunlight
</li>
<li>Abrasion prone
</li>
<li>Flexing
</li>
</ul>
